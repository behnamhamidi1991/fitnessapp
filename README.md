#### `Report`

I finished the first part. This project is very helpful. So I'm not gonna rush when I do it. I finished the first 90 minutes. Now it's time to take care of my other skills.

Next time I should continue from `01:30:00`.
I just finished the responsive header and the shared Button. The next step is to make the hamburger menu work.
